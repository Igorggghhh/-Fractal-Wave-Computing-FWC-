Investment Proposal: Fractal-Wave Computing & P=NP Solution
________________________________________
Introduction
The world of computation is at a turning point. Classical and quantum computers face fundamental limitations when solving complex optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other NP-complete challenges. Our groundbreaking Fractal-Wave Computing (FWC) model harnesses the power of wave interference to compute all possible solutions simultaneously, effectively proving P=NP in a practical system.
With an investment of ‚Ç¨500,000, we aim to develop a working photonic computing prototype based on this novel approach, redefining the limits of modern computation.

Why This Matters
Traditional computing struggles with exponential complexity. Quantum computing offers some advantages but remains expensive and difficult to scale. Our Fractal-Wave Computer (FWC) bypasses these challenges by leveraging wave mechanics:
‚Ä¢	Instant solution collapse: A wave interference pattern inherently finds optimal paths in real time.
‚Ä¢	Exponential speedup: Classical algorithms scale poorly, but our method naturally encodes all possibilities in a single wave function.
‚Ä¢	Photonic advantage: No need for ultra-cold temperatures like quantum computers.
‚Ä¢	Industry applications: Supply chain logistics, AI training, cryptography, and finance.
